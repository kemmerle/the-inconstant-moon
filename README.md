The Inconstant Moon Project

Project Description:
I completed this mini-project (it took one Saturday morning) as a member of the Treehouse Apprenticeship Program for the weekly Code Adventure posted to the Treehouse FSJS Slack Channel. I have noted directly in my project files where I have adapted my css and html from outside sources. The background image and moon image are both open-source and downloaded
from Flickr.com.

The song 'Goodbye, Moonman!' was written by Ryan Elder and Jemaine Clement for the television show 'Rick and Morty'. I'm using this song for purely educational purposes, and I am making no money from this project!

Motivation:
In this project, I hoped to practice with HTML and with CSS, specifically manipulating the page background and images with CSS filter and animation effects.

Getting Started/Installation:
No installations are required. Simply download the repo, and copy the full path of the index.html file into your browser. You can choose different options from the dropdown menu on the leftside of the screen to change the appearance of the moon image.
